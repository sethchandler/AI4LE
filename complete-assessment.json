  "question": "Dave suggested to Fred that they rob a bank. Fred agreed and said that he would go along with Dave when he tries to rob the bank. Unbeknownst to Dave, Fred did not actually want to rob the bank. Rather, he was a member of a terrorist group who wanted to explode a hand grenade in a public place as an act of terror. When Dave asked him to participate in the bank robbery, Fred saw an opportunity to fulfill his goal while having Dave along as an unwitting armed backup. The next day, Dave and Fred approached the bank carrying handguns. Fred also had a hand grenade in his jacket pocket that Dave did not know about. Just as they walked in the bank’s front door with their guns drawn, to Dave’s astonishment, Fred removed the grenade from his pocket, pulled the pin, and threw the grenade into the bank. The explosion damaged the bank, but did not hurt anyone. Bank guard Gus saw Dave and Fred running away with their guns drawn and shot his gun at Fred, killing him. With what crimes may Dave reasonably be charged? Discuss.",
  "studentAnswer": "### Claim\n\nDave may be charged with conspiracy to commit robbery, attempted robbery, and possibly felony murder for Fred’s death.\n\n---\n\n### Rule\n\nA conspiracy occurs when two or more people agree to commit a crime and take an overt act toward its completion. Each conspirator is liable for crimes committed in furtherance of the conspiracy that are reasonably foreseeable. Attempt requires intent to commit the crime and a substantial step toward its completion. Under the felony-murder rule, a killing that occurs during the commission or attempted commission of a dangerous felony—such as robbery—is murder, even if accidental or committed by someone other than the felon, as long as the death is connected to the felony.\n\n---\n\n### Explanation\n\nThe rationale behind conspiracy is that agreement to commit a crime increases the likelihood that it will occur. Therefore, the law punishes the agreement and joint acts even if the crime is not completed. Likewise, attempt punishes conduct that goes beyond mere preparation. Felony murder extends liability to participants in inherently dangerous felonies because the risk of death is high and participants should bear the consequences. However, felony-murder liability may not extend if the killing was not in furtherance of the felony or was committed by someone opposing it (such as a police officer or victim).\n\n---\n\n### Application\n\n**Conspiracy to Commit Robbery:** Dave and Fred agreed to rob a bank. Dave proposed the idea, and Fred agreed to go along. This constitutes an agreement. Their approach to the bank with guns drawn was an overt act. Thus, Dave is guilty of conspiracy to commit robbery. It does not matter that Fred had a different motive; as long as he agreed to rob the bank, the conspiracy is formed.\n\n**Attempted Robbery:** Dave intended to rob the bank and took substantial steps—arming himself, approaching the bank, and drawing his gun. The explosion interrupted the robbery before any money was taken, but those acts likely meet the “substantial step” requirement. Dave is therefore guilty of attempted robbery.\n\n**Destruction of Property/Terrorism-Related Offense:** Fred alone intended to detonate the grenade, but Dave did not share that purpose or even know about it. Since it was outside the scope of the robbery plan, Dave likely is not guilty of the bombing or terrorism-related offense.\n\n**Felony Murder:** Fred was killed by Gus, a bank guard, while the robbery was in progress. Because the death occurred during the commission of an inherently dangerous felony, the prosecution could charge Dave with felony murder. However, a defense might argue that Fred’s death was caused by a third party acting in resistance, which some jurisdictions treat as outside the scope of felony murder. Still, under the proximate cause theory, Dave could be held liable because the death was a foreseeable result of the attempted robbery.\n\n---\n\n### Conclusion\n\nDave can be charged with (1) conspiracy to commit robbery, (2) attempted robbery, and (3) felony murder for Fred’s death. The felony-murder charge is debatable, but most courts would uphold it because the death occurred during an attempted robbery—a dangerous felony that Dave willingly joined.\n\n---\n",
  "modelAnswer": "\nQUESTION 1: SELECTED ANSWER A State v. Dave Solicitation: Requesting, urging, or tempting someone to commit a crime, with the intent that the solicitee commit the crime. Here, the facts state that \"Dave suggested to Fred that they rob a bank.\" Thus, Dave urged Fred to commit a crime, with the specific intent that Fred commit the crime. Therefore, Dave can be found guilty of Solicitation. However, Solicitation merges into the completed crime. Conspiracy: Agreement by two or more persons to commit a crime, with the intent that the crime be committed. Here, \"Fred agreed and said that he would go along with Dave when he tries to rob the bank.\" At Common Law, Conspiracy was complete upon the agreement of the co-conspirator. However, modernly, Conspiracy is a felony and requires some overt act in furtherance of the criminal objective. Here, Dave and Fred approached the bank carrying handguns. Thus, they both committed an overt act in furtherance of the criminal objective, at this point. Additionally, Dave had the specific intent to complete the criminal objective. Therefore, Dave can reasonably be charged with Conspiracy. Feigned Agreement: When only one guilty mind, there can be no Conspiracy. Here, the facts state that \"Unbeknownst to Dave, Fred did not actually want to rob the bank.\" Thus, it would seem that there was only one guilty mind. However, as Fred intended to \"explode a hand grenade in a public place,\" Fred had the requisite guilty mind. Pinkerton Rule: Each co-conspirator is held liable for all crimes that were in furtherance of the criminal objective, and all that were foreseeable. Here, the facts state that Dave did not know that Fred had a grenade, and that Dave was \"astonished\" when Fred removed the grenade from his pocket. However, the use of force by use of a deadly weapon (here, grenade) is foreseeable, as even Dave had a gun drawn. Thus, Fred's acts in relation to the grenade are foreseeable. Therefore, Dave will be guilty of crimes related to Fred's use of the grenade. Malicious Mischief: Damage or destruction of the personal property of another with malice. Here, the \"explosion damaged the bank, but did not hurt anyone.\" Thus, there was damage to the personal property of another (bank owner). Furthermore, Malice can be shown by having the specific intent to commit the crime, or a reckless disregard of an obvious risk. Here, Fred had a specific intent to carry out the \"act of terror.\" Thus, Dave can be reasonably charged with Malicious Mischief, through the vicarious liability imposed on him through the Pinkerton Rule. Attempted Robbery: A substantial step toward the commission of a Robbery with the intent to commit the Robbery. Here, Dave had his gun drawn, entered into the bank, and had the specific intent to commit a Robbery, as the facts state that \"Dave suggested to Fred that they rob a bank.\" Thus, Dave and Fred came dangerously close to the commission of a Robbery. Therefore, Dave can be reasonably charged with Attempted Robbery. Robbery: Trespassory taking and carrying away of the personal property of another from the person or their presence, by use of force or threats of force, with the intent to permanently deprive. Here, as the facts do not state that Dave actually took control and dominion of any personal property from the bank, nor satisfied the element of asportation, he cannot be found guilty of Robbery. Larceny: Trespassory taking and carrying away of the personal property of another with the intent to permanently deprive or steal. Here, similarly, Dave cannot be found guilty of Larceny. Aggravated Assault: Assault with a deadly weapon. Assault is intentionally causing a reasonable apprehension of receiving an immediate battery. Here, Dave and Fred were using guns, and a grenade (deadly weapons). Additionally, they intentionally caused Gus to reasonably apprehend that he would receive an immediate battery, as there was an apparent ability to carry out the battery by use of gun or explosive. Therefore, Dave can be reasonably charged with committing an Aggravated Assault. Burglary: Trespassory breaking and entering into the dwelling house of another, in the nighttime, with the intent to commit a felony therein. Here, Fred and Dave entered into the bank, with the specific intent to rob the bank. However, a bank is not a dwelling house. Furthermore, the facts state that Fred and Dave entered the bank \"The next day.\" Therefore, Dave cannot be charged for Common Law Burglary. Statutory Burglary: Entry into any structure with the intent to commit a crime therein. Here, Fred and Dave entered as the facts state that they \"walked in the bank's front door.\" The bank is a structure. Finally, they had the specific intent to commit a robbery therein (a crime). Therefore, Dave can reasonably be charged with Modern Burglary, but not Common Law Burglary. Murder: A homicide with malice aforethought. Homicide: The killing of one human being by another. The defendant's act must have been the actual and proximate cause of the victim's death. Killing of One Human Being: No particular means are required. Here, Fred, a human being was killed. Actual Cause: The defendant will be the actual cause of the victim's death if they would not have died but for the defendant's act. Otherwise, if there are multiple sufficient causes, the defendant will be the actual cause of the victim's death if their actions were a Substantial factor in bringing about the victim's death. Here, Fred would not have died, but for the bank guard, Gus, shooting his gun at Fred, killing him.\" However, as Dave was an accomplice to the crime, he is a Substantial Factor in bringing about Fred's death, and will be found to be the actual cause. Year and a Day Rule: Under the Common Law, the victim must die within one year and one day from the date of the incident. Here, Fred died instantly. Thus, this element is satisfied. Proximate Cause: The defendant will be the indirect proximate cause of the victim's death if there was an intervening act by a third party or act of God, and the intervening act was foreseeable. Here, the bank guard, Gus, made an effort to protect persons and property of the bank. Efforts to protect persons or property are considered foreseeable. Thus, the intervening act of Gus was foreseeable. Therefore, Dave's act of burglary is the indirect Proximate cause of Fred's death. Therefore, Dave is criminally liable for the homicide of Fred. Malice: Malice can be established by one of the following: Intent to Kill: Here, the facts do not show that Dave had the specific intent to kill Fred, nor knowledge of substantial certainty that Dave's death would occur. Thus, Malice will not be shown this way. Intent to Cause Serious Bodily Injury: Here, the facts do not show that Dave had the specific intent to cause Fred any serious bodily injury, as Dave and Fred were running away together. Thus, Malice will not be shown this way. Wanton Conduct: Showing an extreme indifference to the value of human life by an act that poses a very high risk of death, has little or no social value, done intentionally, where the defendant was aware of the risk. Here, Dave's conduct of Attempted Robbery with use of a gun (deadly weapon) constituted an act that posed a very high risk of death, and which had little or no social value, which was also done intentionally, and where Dave was aware of the risk that his actions posed. Thus, Dave can be found to have committed Wanton Conduct. However, if the courts do not find that Dave's conduct amounted to Wanton Conduct, the next best theory is Involuntary Manslaughter. Felony Murder Rule: When a death is caused during the perpetration of an inherently dangerous, collateral felony, then the underlying felony will replace and satisfy the element of Malice. Here, Dave was engaged in the act of Attempted Robbery with a deadly weapon. Thus, his act was inherently dangerous, as it posed a high risk of death. Additionally, the crime of Robbery is collateral and independent to the act which actually brought about the homicide of Fred. Thus, the Attempted Robbery by Dave will replace and satisfy the element of Malice. Res Gestae: The death must occur during the perpetration of the felony, for the defendant to be found guilty. The Res Gestae begins when the attempt of the felony becomes viable and lasts until the felon(s) reach a place of temporary or seeming safety. Here, Dave was in the bank with a gun. Thus, the attempt to rob became viable. Further, the facts state that \"Dave and Fred were running away with their guns drawn.\" Thus, they did not reach a place of temporary or seeming safety, as they were still fleeing when Fred was shot by Gus. Thus, the death occurred during the Res Gestae. Red-line View: Under the Common Law, when a co-felon dies at the hands of another, the defendant will be found guilty of Felony Murder. However, under the modern Red-line View, a defendant will not be held guilty of Felony Murder when a cofelon dies at the hands of an innocent third party. Here, Gus is an innocent third party, who actually shot and killed Fred, the co-felon. Thus, if the jurisdiction follows the Redline View, then Dave will Not be found guilty of Felony murder. However, under Common Law, Dave will be found guilty of Felony Murder. First Degree Felony Murder: When a death occurs during the perpetration of an enumerated felony. Traditionally, Burglary and Robbery are both considered enumerated felonies. Thus, if Dave is found guilty of Felony Murder (established above), he can also be reasonably found guilty of First- Degree Felony Murder. Involuntary Manslaughter: Homicide without malice while committing a wrongful act. Here, if Dave is not found guilty of Felony Murder, and his conduct is not found to amount to Wanton Conduct, then the next best theory is Involuntary Manslaughter. Dave is liable for the homicide of Fred (established above). If malice cannot be found, then Dave’s wrongful act of Assault will suffice. Therefore, Dave can be reasonably charged with Involuntary Manslaughter. Therefore, Dave can be reasonably charged with committing Solicitation, Conspiracy, Attempted Robbery, Statutory Burglary, Malicious Mischief, Aggravated Assault, Second Degree Felony Murder or First- Degree Felony Murder, or Involuntary Manslaughte",

  "assessment": "Of course. As an expert legal writing professor, I will provide a comprehensive assessment of the student's answer based on the provided materials.\n\n---\n\n### **Overall Assessment**\n\nThis is a strong answer that demonstrates a solid grasp of fundamental legal writing structure (CREAC) and a good ability to spot major issues. The student correctly identified the primary crimes Dave could be charged with and organized the analysis in a clear, logical manner. However, the answer falls short of an excellent score due to a lack of analytical depth on key legal nuances, particularly regarding the elements of conspiracy and the jurisdictional splits concerning felony murder. The analysis often identifies the correct conclusion without fully exploring the complex legal reasoning required to get there, which is what separates competent analysis from expert-level analysis.\n\n**Final Score: 84/100**\n\n---\n\n### **Detailed Breakdown by Skill Area**\n\nHere is a detailed assessment of the student's performance based on the provided rubric.\n\n#### **1. Analytical Depth (42/50)**\n\nThis is the area with the most room for improvement. While the student reaches generally correct conclusions, the reasoning often lacks the required nuance.\n\n*   **Strengths:**\n    *   **Felony Murder:** The student's analysis here is the strongest part of the answer. They correctly identified that the killing was by a third party (Gus) and astutely noted that this is a critical distinction. The student correctly states that \"a defense might argue that Fred’s death was caused by a third party acting in resistance\" (the agency theory) but then correctly counters that \"under the proximate cause theory, Dave could be held liable.\" This demonstrates an understanding of the jurisdictional split, which is an advanced analytical skill.\n    *   **Accomplice Liability (Grenade):** The student correctly concludes that Dave is not liable for the grenade explosion because it was \"outside the scope of the robbery plan.\" This shows a correct application of the foreseeability limitation on co-conspirator liability.\n\n*   **Areas for Improvement:**\n    *   **Conspiracy:** This was the biggest analytical miss. The student states, \"Dave and Fred agreed to rob a bank... This constitutes an agreement.\" This completely overlooks the most critical fact regarding the conspiracy charge: **Fred was feigning agreement**. An expert analysis would have seized on this fact to discuss the two main jurisdictional approaches:\n        *   **Bilateral (Common Law):** Under this approach, there is no conspiracy because there was no \"meeting of two or more guilty minds.\" Dave cannot conspire with himself.\n        *   **Unilateral (MPC/Modern):** Under this approach, Dave *would* be guilty of conspiracy because liability is assessed based on the defendant's own mens rea. The fact that Fred secretly did not agree is irrelevant to Dave's guilt.\n    *   **Foreseeability:** While the conclusion on the grenade was correct, the analysis could have been strengthened by directly using the fact pattern's language. Mentioning that Dave was \"astonished\" is powerful evidence that the act was not foreseeable to him, bolstering the argument against liability.\n\n#### **2. Rule Statement (16/20)**\n\nThe student states the rules generally correctly, but they lack the precision and completeness expected in a top-tier answer.\n\n*   **Strengths:**\n    *   The definitions for attempt (\"intent... and a substantial step\") and co-conspirator liability (\"in furtherance of the conspiracy that are reasonably foreseeable\") are accurate and concise.\n\n*   **Areas for Improvement:**\n    *   **Conspiracy:** The rule provided (\"two or more people agree... and take an overt act\") is a basic definition that omits the crucial bilateral/unilateral distinction necessary to analyze the facts of this case properly.\n    *   **Felony Murder:** The rule states that liability exists as long as the death is \"connected to the felony.\" This is too vague. An excellent rule statement would have explicitly laid out the competing **agency theory** (felons are only responsible for killings committed by their agents/co-felons) and the **proximate cause theory** (felons are responsible for any foreseeable killing that is the proximate result of the felony). While the student alludes to this in the analysis, it should be stated clearly in the rule section.\n\n#### **3. Issue Spotting (12/15)**\n\nThe student did a good job identifying the main issues but could have been more comprehensive.\n\n*   **Issues Spotted Correctly:**\n    1.  Conspiracy to commit robbery\n    2.  Attempted robbery\n    3.  Felony murder for Fred’s death\n\n*   **Issues Missed or Underdeveloped:**\n    1.  **Liability for the Grenade Explosion:** The student addresses this in the \"Application\" section but does not frame it as a primary issue of co-conspirator liability (under the *Pinkerton* doctrine). An expert answer would treat this as a distinct analytical point: Is Dave vicariously liable for Fred's criminal act of exploding the grenade?\n    2.  **Lesser Included Offenses/Other Crimes:** The model answer correctly shows that a top-tier analysis would also briefly consider and dismiss or affirm other potential charges like solicitation (which merges), aggravated assault, and statutory burglary, demonstrating a comprehensive command of the subject matter.\n\n#### **4. Organization (14/15)**\n\nThe organization is the student's greatest strength. The answer is exceptionally well-structured and easy to follow.\n\n*   **Strengths:**\n    *   The student uses a clear CREAC (Claim-Rule-Explanation-Application-Conclusion) structure, which is a highly effective format for legal analysis.\n    *   The use of bolded headings for each crime within the \"Application\" section makes the analysis scannable and logically segmented.\n    *   The separation of the \"Rule\" from the \"Explanation\" (rationale) is a sophisticated choice that adds clarity.\n\nThe structure is nearly perfect and serves as a model for how to organize a legal analysis answer.\n\n### **Actionable Advice for Improvement**\n\n1.  **Embrace Ambiguity and Jurisdictional Splits:** When you see a fact that complicates a legal element (like Fred feigning agreement), that is your signal to slow down. Your analysis should explain *why* that fact is a problem and how different legal rules (e.g., bilateral vs. unilateral conspiracy) would resolve it. Always ask: \"Is there another way to look at this?\"\n2.  **State Rules with Precision:** Define legal rules completely, including any significant exceptions or competing theories (like the agency vs. proximate cause rules for felony murder). Stating these upfront provides a roadmap for your analysis.\n3.  **Use Every Fact:** The fact that Dave was \"astonished\" was a gift from the exam writer. Use specific facts like this as evidence to support your analytical arguments about foreseeability and intent.\n4.  **Consider the \"Full Spectrum\" of Crimes:** For bonus points and to demonstrate mastery, briefly consider other related"
