## LEGAL WRITING ASSESSMENT: Faculty Feedback Report

### Overall Assessment

**Framework Used:** IRAC (appropriate for exam format)  
**Suggested Score Range:** 70-75/100

The student demonstrates basic competency in legal analysis but shows significant weaknesses in analytical depth. The answer correctly identifies key issues and provides generally accurate rule statements, but suffers from conclusory reasoning, superficial application, and lack of rigorous fact-to-rule connections.

### Component-by-Component Analysis

#### **Issue Spotting & Framework: 11/15**

**Strengths:**

- Correctly identifies the three main issues (state action, standing, Dormant Commerce Clause)
- Uses proper IRAC structure with neutral issue statements
- Organizes issues logically

**Areas for Improvement:**

- **State action issue is unnecessary.** The model answer correctly recognizes this is implicit in a § 1983 suit against a state officer under _Ex parte Young_. Including it wastes valuable exam time and suggests misunderstanding of constitutional litigation basics.
- Issues could be framed more precisely. Compare your "whether MOSA violates the Dormant Commerce Clause" to the model's specific framing: "whether the complaint states a claim under the Dormant Commerce Clause—either as a per se invalid extraterritorial regulation or under the _Pike_ balancing test."

**Guiding Questions:**

- When would state action _not_ be present in a suit challenging a state statute enforced by a state AG?
- How can you make your issue statements more precise by incorporating the specific legal tests that will govern your analysis?

---

#### **Rule Statements: 14/20**

**Strengths:**

- Cites key cases (_Lujan_, _Hunt_, _Healy_, _Pike_)
- Covers basic elements of each test
- Generally accurate statements of law

**Significant Weaknesses:**

1. **State Action Rule is elementary and irrelevant.** The _Civil Rights Cases_ (1883) addresses private discrimination, not challenges to state statutes. This signals a fundamental misunderstanding.
    
2. **Standing rule lacks precision.** You cite _Hunt_ and _Lujan_ but don't explain:
    
    - The pre-enforcement standing standard from _Susan B. Anthony List_
    - What constitutes a "credible threat of enforcement"
    - How _Ex parte Young_ provides jurisdictional basis
3. **DCC rule lacks the critical framework distinction.** Compare your treatment to the model's:
    
    - You: "States cannot make laws that directly regulate interstate commerce or that put too heavy a burden on it."
    - Model: Distinguishes _per se_ invalidity under _Healy_ from _Pike_ balancing, then explains how _National Pork Producers v. Ross_ (2023) narrowed _Healy_'s scope
4. **Missing funnel structure.** Your rules jump immediately to elements without providing the broader context first.
    

**Guiding Questions:**

- How does the recent _Ross_ decision affect the extraterritoriality analysis under _Healy_?
- What is the specific standard for pre-enforcement standing, and how does it differ from standard Article III injury requirements?
- For each legal test you state, have you explained what each element means and how courts apply it?

---

#### **Application/Analysis: 28/50**

This is where your answer suffers most significantly. The application contains numerous **conclusory statements** and lacks the rigorous fact-to-rule connections essential for strong legal analysis.

**Conclusory Statements Identified:**

1. "The Ohio blogger's $50,000 cost is an economic injury."
    
    - **Why conclusory:** You assert it's an injury without explaining _how_ this satisfies the "concrete and particularized" requirement or what makes it "imminent" rather than speculative.
2. "The French forum says it will block all U.S. users, which also counts as harm."
    
    - **Why conclusory:** You conclude this "counts as harm" without explaining _why_ blocking users satisfies Article III injury requirements.
3. "NetChoice probably meets the test because the Attorney General said he will enforce the law 'on day one,' so the threat is not speculative."
    
    - **Why conclusory:** You state the conclusion without showing how the AG's statement creates a "credible threat" under the _Susan B. Anthony List_ standard.
4. "Because the law affects people and companies in other states, there is a good argument it regulates beyond California's borders."
    
    - **Why conclusory:** Affecting others isn't the same as impermissible extraterritorial regulation. You need to explain _what makes this regulation extraterritorial_ under the legal standard.
5. "The burden on business seems high compared to the benefit, especially since websites already have filters and parental controls."
    
    - **Why conclusory:** You conclude the burden "seems high" without analyzing specific economic impacts, the balkanization problem, or systematically weighing each factor.

**Compare to Model's Approach:**

The model answer demonstrates what thorough application looks like:

- **On standing injury:** "The Ohio food blogger's declaration alleges she faces a concrete, imminent economic injury: she must either incur a $50,000 annual compliance cost to implement a state-approved age-verification system or cease operations entirely... Those allegations describe a classic pre-enforcement 'Hobson's choice'—comply at significant cost or risk penalties under a law the Attorney General has announced will be 'actively enforced on day one.'"
    
- **On extraterritoriality:** "MOSA's text sweeps broadly—it applies to 'any website accessible in California,' not merely those targeting California users—and thus risks functioning as a de facto nationwide mandate. Internet regulation complicates the _Ross_ framework because the 'in-state' and 'out-of-state' components of online communication are effectively inseparable."
    

**Missing Elements:**

1. **No engagement with _Ross_**. The model recognizes this 2023 decision narrowed extraterritoriality doctrine. You don't mention it, suggesting your research missed recent controlling authority.
    
2. **No counterargument analysis on standing**. The model addresses the AG's likely argument that injuries are speculative and that websites could geo-block California. You mention the AG "says" something but don't develop or rebut the argument.
    
3. **Superficial Pike balancing**. You list benefits and burdens but don't:
    
    - Explain _why_ child protection is compelling (citing _Ginsberg_)
    - Discuss the **balkanization problem** (if 50 states each pass conflicting laws)
    - Analyze technical feasibility and internet's borderless architecture
    - Compare the magnitude of burdens to the effectiveness of the regulation
4. **No analogical reasoning**. The model cites _American Libraries Ass'n v. Pataki_ and _PSINet v. Chapman_ to show how federal courts have treated similar internet regulations. You cite no precedent for comparison.
    
5. **Hedging language undermines analysis**. Phrases like "probably," "likely," and "seems" appear throughout. While some tentativeness is appropriate on close questions, you use hedging even for straightforward points.
    

**Guiding Questions:**

- For each legal conclusion you make, can you identify the specific facts that satisfy each element of the legal test?
- How would you rewrite "The Ohio blogger's $50,000 cost is an economic injury" to show _how_ this satisfies the "concrete and particularized" requirement?
- What is the strongest counterargument the AG could make on the extraterritoriality issue, and how would you rebut it?
- Which precedent cases involve similar regulatory problems, and how do their facts compare to MOSA?
- In your _Pike_ balancing, what specific evidence suggests the burdens are "clearly excessive" relative to California's interest?

---

#### **Conclusion: 5/5**

**Strengths:**

- Directly answers each issue
- No new arguments introduced
- Appropriately concise

Your conclusions are adequate, though they lack the nuance of the model (which acknowledges the extraterritoriality issue is "close" and "best resolved on a fuller record").

---

#### **Organization: 12/15**

**Strengths:**

- Clear IRAC structure for each issue
- Logical sequencing of issues
- Appropriate transitions between sections

**Weaknesses:**

- **Wasted space on state action**. This bloats the memo without adding value.
- **Unbalanced treatment**. Your standing analysis gets ~6 sentences; DCC gets ~8 sentences. The model spends multiple paragraphs on standing (explaining the _Hunt_ factors, pre-enforcement standard, and counterarguments) and even more on DCC.
- **Application doesn't mirror rule structure**. For example, you state the _Hunt_ three-factor test but then don't systematically analyze each factor.

**Guiding Questions:**

- Does each element mentioned in your rule section receive explicit treatment in your application?
- Should routine threshold issues receive the same depth of analysis as complex substantive questions?
- How does the model's organization differ from yours, and why might those differences matter?

---

### Key Strengths

1. **Correct framework selection** (IRAC for exam context)
2. **Issue identification** (aside from unnecessary state action)
3. **Basic legal accuracy** in rule statements
4. **Clear writing** that is easy to follow

---

### Priority Improvements (Ranked by Impact)

#### **1. Eliminate Conclusory Statements (Highest Priority)**

Your application section is dominated by assertions without factual support. This is the single most serious flaw in legal writing.

**Exercise:** Go through your application section and highlight every sentence that makes a legal conclusion. For each, ask:

- What specific facts demonstrate this?
- How do those facts satisfy the specific elements of the legal test?
- Can I rewrite this using "because" to connect facts to law?

**Example revision:**

- ❌ "The Ohio blogger's $50,000 cost is an economic injury."
- ✅ "The Ohio blogger faces an imminent economic injury because MOSA forces her to choose between paying $50,000 annually for age-verification software—a cost she cannot afford and that would eliminate her livelihood—or shutting down entirely, satisfying the 'concrete and particularized' injury requirement under _Lujan_."

#### **2. Develop Thorough Fact-to-Rule Connections**

Strong legal analysis explicitly shows how specific facts satisfy specific legal elements.

**Guiding questions for every analytical paragraph:**

- Which specific facts am I analyzing?
- Which specific legal element or standard applies?
- How do these particular facts satisfy (or fail to satisfy) this particular element?
- What linking language (because, since, as, therefore) connects my facts to my conclusion?

#### **3. Engage with Counterarguments**

You mention what "the Attorney General argues" but don't fully develop or rebut these arguments. Strong analysis anticipates the strongest opposing position and explains why it fails.

**Guiding questions:**

- What is the _strongest_ argument against my conclusion (not a strawman)?
- What facts or legal authorities support that opposing view?
- How do I respond to that argument?
- Why does my position prevail despite the counterargument's force?

#### **4. Use Precedent for Analogical Reasoning**

Legal analysis isn't just applying abstract rules—it's comparing your facts to how courts have decided similar cases.

**Exercise:** For the extraterritoriality issue, research cases involving state regulation of the internet. Then answer:

- What were the key facts in those cases?
- How are they similar to MOSA?
- How are they different?
- Why should those similarities (or differences) control the outcome here?

#### **5. Update Your Legal Research**

The model cites _National Pork Producers Council v. Ross_ (2023), a Supreme Court decision that significantly narrowed extraterritoriality doctrine. Missing recent controlling authority is a serious research failure.

**Practice tip:** Always Shepardize or KeyCite your cases. After finding foundational cases like _Healy_, check for subsequent history and recent cases that cite or distinguish them.

---

### Structural Issues

1. **State action analysis is unnecessary** and suggests misunderstanding of § 1983 litigation against state officers.
    
2. **Insufficient depth** on complex issues. An exam answer on DCC extraterritoriality and _Pike_ balancing needs more than two short paragraphs per issue.
    
3. **No synthesis of issues**. The model's conclusion acknowledges the relationship between standing and merits ("credible enforcement threat" both establishes standing and strengthens the DCC claim). You treat them as entirely separate.
    

---

### Final Observations

Your answer demonstrates basic legal competency but reads like an outline rather than a fully developed analysis. You identify relevant issues and cite appropriate authority, but you don't _show your work_—you don't demonstrate _how_ the facts satisfy the law.

Think of legal analysis as a mathematical proof. You wouldn't write "5 + 3 = 8" without showing your work. Similarly, you can't write "The Ohio blogger faces economic injury" without showing how the specific facts (must pay $50,000, will lose livelihood, no way to comply) satisfy the specific legal elements (concrete, particularized, imminent).

The difference between your answer and the model is not knowledge of law—you know the relevant tests. The difference is **analytical rigor**: connecting facts to rules with precision, engaging counterarguments thoroughly, using precedent for comparison, and eliminating conclusory leaps.

**Recommended next steps:**

1. Review the model answer paragraph by paragraph, noting how it connects facts to law
2. Rewrite your application sections using "because" clauses to link every conclusion to supporting facts
3. For each issue, identify the strongest counterargument and write a full rebuttal paragraph
4. Find and read the precedent cases cited in the model, then incorporate them into your analysis

**Scoring Summary:**

- Issue Spotting & Framework: 11/15
- Rule Statements: 14/20
- Application/Analysis: 28/50
- Conclusion: 5/5
- Organization: 12/15

**Total: 70-75/100** (C+ to B- range)

With focused work on eliminating conclusory statements and strengthening fact-to-rule connections, you could easily reach B+ to A- range on future exams.
