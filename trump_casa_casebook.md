# TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES, et al. v. CASA, INC., et al.

606 U.S. 831 (2025)

**Justice Barrett delivered the opinion of the Court.**

The United States has filed three emergency applications challenging the scope of a federal court's authority to enjoin Government officials from enforcing an executive order. Traditionally, courts issued injunctions prohibiting executive officials from enforcing a challenged law or policy only against the plaintiffs in the lawsuit. The injunctions before us today reflect a more recent development: district courts asserting the power to prohibit enforcement of a law or policy against anyone. These injunctions—known as "universal injunctions"—likely exceed the equitable authority that Congress has granted to federal courts. We therefore grant the Government's applications to partially stay the injunctions entered below.

## I

[The applications concern three overlapping universal preliminary injunctions entered by three different District Courts. Plaintiffs—individuals, organizations, and States—challenged President Trump's Executive Order No. 14160, which identifies circumstances in which a person born in the United States is not "subject to the jurisdiction thereof" and is thus not recognized as an American citizen under the Fourteenth Amendment's Citizenship Clause. The Executive Order provides that U.S. citizenship does not extend to persons born to a mother unlawfully present in the United States, or lawfully present on a temporary basis, and a father who is neither a citizen nor lawful permanent resident.

In each case, the District Court concluded that the Executive Order is likely unlawful and entered a universal preliminary injunction barring various executive officials from applying the policy to anyone in the country. The Courts of Appeals denied the Government's request to stay the sweeping relief.]

The Government has now filed three nearly identical applications seeking to partially stay the universal preliminary injunctions and limit them to the parties. The applications do not raise—and thus we do not address—the question whether the Executive Order violates the Citizenship Clause or Nationality Act. The issue before us is one of remedy: whether, under the Judiciary Act of 1789, federal courts have equitable authority to issue universal injunctions.

## II

The question whether Congress has granted federal courts the authority to universally enjoin the enforcement of an executive or legislative policy plainly warrants our review, as Members of this Court have repeatedly emphasized. ... On multiple occasions, and across administrations, the Solicitor General has asked us to consider the propriety of this expansive remedy.

It is easy to see why. By the end of the Biden administration, we had reached "a state of affairs where almost every major presidential act [was] immediately frozen by a federal district court." W. Baude & S. Bray, Comment, Proper Parties, Proper Relief, 137 Harv. L. Rev. 153, 174 (2023). The trend has continued: During the first 100 days of the second Trump administration, district courts issued approximately 25 universal injunctions. Congressional Research Service, J. Lampe, Nationwide Injunctions in the First Hundred Days of the Second Trump Administration 1 (May 16, 2025). As the number of universal injunctions has increased, so too has the importance of the issue.

## III

### A

The Government is likely to succeed on the merits of its argument regarding the scope of relief. ... A universal injunction can be justified only as an exercise of equitable authority, yet Congress has granted federal courts no such power.

The Judiciary Act of 1789 endowed federal courts with jurisdiction over "all suits . . . in equity," and still today, this statute "is what authorizes the federal courts to issue equitable remedies." S. Bray & E. Sherwin, Remedies 442 (4th ed. 2024). Though flexible, this equitable authority is not freewheeling. We have held that the statutory grant encompasses only those sorts of equitable remedies "traditionally accorded by courts of equity" at our country's inception. Grupo Mexicano de Desarrollo, S.A. v. Alliance Bond Fund, Inc., 527 U.S. 308, 319 (1999). ... We must therefore ask whether universal injunctions are sufficiently "analogous" to the relief issued "by the High Court of Chancery in England at the time of the adoption of the Constitution and the enactment of the original Judiciary Act." Grupo Mexicano, 527 U.S., at 318–319.

The answer is no: Neither the universal injunction nor any analogous form of relief was available in the High Court of Chancery in England at the time of the founding. Equity offered a mechanism for the Crown "to secure justice where it would not be secured by the ordinary and existing processes of law." G. Adams, The Origin of English Equity, 16 Colum. L. Rev. 87, 91 (1916). This "judicial prerogative of the King" thus extended to "those causes which the ordinary judges were incapable of determining." 1 J. Pomeroy, Equity Jurisprudence § 31, p. 27 (1881). ...

[The "general rule in Equity [was] that all persons materially interested [in the suit were] to be made parties to it." J. Story, Commentaries on Equity Pleadings § 72, p. 74. Injunctions were no exception; there were "sometimes suits to restrain the actions of particular officers against particular plaintiffs." S. Bray, Multiple Chancellors: Reforming the National Injunction, 131 Harv. L. Rev. 417, 425 (Bray, Multiple Chancellors). Of importance here, suits in equity were brought by and against individual parties, and the Chancellor's remedies were generally party specific. See Iveson v. Harris, 7 Ves. 251, 257, 32 Eng. Rep. 102, 104 ("[Y]ou cannot have an injunction except against a party to the suit"). In sum, under longstanding equity practice in England, there was no remedy "remotely like a national injunction." Bray, Multiple Chancellors 425.]

Nor did founding-era courts of equity in the United States chart a different course. If anything, the approach traditionally taken by federal courts cuts against the existence of such a sweeping remedy. Consider Scott v. Donald, where the plaintiff successfully challenged the constitutionality of a law on which state officials had relied to confiscate alcohol that the plaintiff kept for personal use. See 165 U.S. 107, 109 (statement of case). Although the plaintiff sought an injunction barring enforcement of the law against both himself and anyone "whose rights [were] infringed and threatened" by it, the Court permitted only relief benefitting the named plaintiff. Id., at 115–117. In the ensuing decades, the Court consistently rebuffed requests for relief that extended beyond the parties. See, e.g., Perkins v. Lukens Steel Co., 310 U.S. 113, 123; Frothingham v. Mellon, decided with Massachusetts v. Mellon, 262 U.S. 447, 487–489.

The Court's early refusals to grant relief to nonparties are consistent with the party-specific principles that permeate the Court's understanding of equity. "[N]either declaratory nor injunctive relief," the Court has said, "can directly interfere with enforcement of contested statutes or ordinances except with respect to the particular federal plaintiffs." Doran v. Salem Inn, Inc., 422 U.S. 922, 931. In fact, universal injunctions were conspicuously nonexistent for most of the Nation's history. Their absence from 18th and 19th century equity practice settles the question of judicial authority.

While "equity is flexible," Grupo Mexicano, 527 U.S., at 322, the Court's precedent emphasizes that its "flexibility is confined within the broad boundaries of traditional equitable relief." Ibid. Because the universal injunction lacks a historical pedigree, it falls outside the bounds of a federal court's equitable authority under the Judiciary Act.

### B

[... Lengthy discussion of respondents' arguments omitted ...]

Respondents defend universal injunctions as a matter of policy; the Government advances policy arguments running the other way. As with most questions of law, the policy pros and cons are beside the point. Under the Court's well-established precedent, see Grupo Mexicano, 527 U.S., at 319, because universal injunctions lack a founding-era forebear, federal courts lack authority to issue them.

### C

To obtain interim relief, the Government must show that it is likely to suffer irreparable harm absent a stay. Nken, 556 U.S., at 434–435. When a federal court enters a universal injunction against the Government, it "improper[ly] intru[des]" on "a coordinate branch of the Government" and prevents the Government from enforcing its policies against nonparties. INS v. Legalization Assistance Project of Los Angeles County Federation of Labor, 510 U.S. 1301, 1306 (O'Connor, J., in chambers). ... The Government here is likely to suffer irreparable harm from the District Courts' entry of injunctions that likely exceed the authority conferred by the Judiciary Act. And the balance of equities does not counsel against awarding the Government interim relief: A partial stay will cause no harm to respondents because they will remain protected by the preliminary injunctions to the extent necessary and appropriate to afford them complete relief.

### D

When a court concludes that the Executive Branch has acted unlawfully, the answer is not for the court to exceed its power, too. The Government's applications for partial stays of the preliminary injunctions are granted, but only to the extent that the injunctions are broader than necessary to provide complete relief to each plaintiff with standing to sue.

Applications for partial stays granted.

**Justice Thomas, with whom Justice Gorsuch joins, concurring.**

The Court today holds that federal courts may not issue so-called universal injunctions. I agree and join in full. As the Court explains, the Judiciary Act of 1789—the statute that "authorizes the federal courts to issue equitable remedies"—does not permit universal injunctions. Ante, at 841. It authorizes only those remedies traditionally available in equity, and there is no historical tradition allowing courts to provide "relief that extend[s] beyond the parties." Ante, at 841–847. That conclusion is dispositive: As I have previously explained, "[i]f district courts have any authority to issue universal injunctions," it must come from some specific statutory or constitutional grant. Trump v. Hawaii, 585 U.S. 667, 713–714 (2018) (concurring opinion). But, the Judiciary Act is the only real possibility, and serious constitutional questions would arise even if Congress purported to one day allow universal injunctions. See id., at 714, n. 2.

I write separately to emphasize the majority's guidance regarding how courts should tailor remedies specific to the parties. Courts must not distort "the rule that injunctive relief should be no more burdensome to the defendant than necessary to provide complete relief to the plaintiffs." Califano v. Yamasaki, 442 U.S. 682, 702 (1979). Otherwise, they risk replicating the problems of universal injunctions under the guise of granting complete relief.

As the Court recognizes, the complete-relief principle operates as a ceiling: In no circumstance can a court award relief beyond that necessary to redress the plaintiffs' injuries. See ante, at 854 ("Complete relief is not a guarantee—it is the maximum a court can provide"). This limitation follows from both Article III and traditional equitable practice. Because Article III limits courts to resolving specific "Cases" and "Controversies," see U.S. Const., Art. III, § 2, it requires that any remedy "be tailored to redress the plaintiff's particular injury." Gill v. Whitford, 585 U.S. 48, 73 (2018). And, equitable remedies historically operated on a plaintiff-specific basis. Ante, at 842–844. Accordingly, any "remedy must of course be limited to the inadequacy that produced the injury in fact that the plaintiff has established." Lewis v. Casey, 518 U.S. 343, 357 (1996).

Courts therefore err insofar as they treat complete relief as a mandate. Some judges have read our precedents to suggest that courts should provide plaintiffs whatever remedy is necessary to give them complete relief. ... But, that reading misunderstands the complete-relief principle. This principle reflects the equitable "rule that courts generally 'may administer complete relief between the parties.'" Ante, at 851 (emphasis deleted). It is an important "aim of the law of remedies ... to put the plaintiff in her rightful position." S. Bray, Multiple Chancellors: Reforming the National Injunction, 131 Harv. L. Rev. 417, 466 (2017) (Bray). But, "to say that a court can award complete relief is not to say that it should do so." Ante, at 853–854. And, in some circumstances, a court cannot award complete relief.

[To be sure, "[w]hat counts as complete relief" can be a difficult question. Bray 467. Many plaintiffs argue that only sweeping relief can redress their injuries. And, I do not dispute that there will be cases requiring an "indivisible remedy" that incidentally benefits third parties, ... such as "[i]njunctions barring public nuisances." Hawaii, 585 U.S., at 717 (Thomas, J., concurring). But, such cases are by far the exception.

An indivisible remedy is appropriate only when it would be "all but impossible" to devise relief that reaches only the plaintiffs. Ante, at 852, n. 12. Such impossibility is a high bar. ... As the Court recognizes, "prohibiting enforcement of the Executive Order against the child of an individual pregnant plaintiff" is all that is required to "give that plaintiff complete relief." Ante, at 852–853. Courts may not use the complete-relief principle to revive the universal injunction.]

For good reason, the Court today puts an end to the "increasingly common" practice of federal courts issuing universal injunctions. Hawaii, 585 U.S., at 713 (Thomas, J., concurring). The Court also makes clear that the complete-relief principle provides a ceiling on federal courts' authority, which must be applied alongside other "principles of equity" and our holding that universal injunctions are impermissible. Ante, at 861. Lower courts should carefully heed this Court's guidance and cabin their grants of injunctive relief in light of historical equitable limits. If they cannot do so, this Court will continue to be "dutybound" to intervene. Hawaii, 585 U.S., at 721 (Thomas, J., concurring).

**Justice Alito, with whom Justice Thomas joins, concurring.**

I join the opinion of the Court but write separately to note two related issues that are left unresolved and potentially threaten the practical significance of today's decision: the availability of third-party standing and class certification.

First, the Court does not address the weighty issue whether the state plaintiffs have third-party standing to assert the Citizenship Clause claims of their individual residents. See ante, at 838, n. 2; see also ante, at 861 ("The Government's applications to partially stay the preliminary injunctions are granted, but only to the extent that the injunctions are broader than necessary to provide complete relief to each plaintiff with standing to sue" (emphasis added)). Ordinarily, "a litigant must assert his or her own legal rights and interests, and cannot rest a claim to relief on the legal rights or interests of third parties." Powers v. Ohio, 499 U.S. 400, 410 (1991). In limited circumstances, however, the Court has permitted a party to assert the rights of a third party. Admittedly, the Court has not pinned down the precise circumstances in which third-party standing is permissible. See Lexmark Int'l, Inc. v. Static Control Components, Inc., 572 U.S. 118, 127, n. 3 (2014).

But at a minimum, we have said that a litigant seeking to assert the legal rights or interests of others must demonstrate ordinary Article III standing for itself and answer the additional "threshold question whether [it has] standing to raise the rights of others." Kowalski v. Tesmer, 543 U.S. 125, 129 (2004). ... This latter requirement, as we have explained, entails a showing that the litigant has a "close relationship" to the right holder and that there is some "'hindrance'" to the right holder's ability to "protect his own interests." Kowalski, 543 U.S., at 130 (quoting Powers, 499 U.S., at 411). So long as third-party standing doctrine remains good law, federal courts should take care to apply these limitations conscientiously, including against state plaintiffs. That is especially so in cases such as these, in which the parties claiming third-party standing (i.e., the States) are not directly subject to the challenged policy in the relevant respect and face, at most, collateral injuries.

Today's decision only underscores the need for rigorous and evenhanded enforcement of third-party-standing limitations. The Court holds today that injunctive relief should generally extend only to the suing plaintiff. See ante, at 851–852. That will have the salutary effect of bringing an end to the practice of runaway "universal" injunctions, but it leaves other questions unanswered. Perhaps most important, when a State brings a suit to vindicate the rights of individual residents and then procures injunctive relief, does the injunction bind the defendant with respect to all residents of that State? If so, States will have every incentive to bring third-party suits on behalf of their residents to obtain a broader scope of equitable relief than any individual resident could procure in his own suit. Left unchecked, the practice of reflexive state third-party standing will undermine today's decision as a practical matter.

Second, today's decision will have very little value if district courts award relief to broadly defined classes without following "Rule 23's procedural protections" for class certification. Ante, at 849. The class action is a powerful tool, and we have accordingly held that class "certification is proper only if the trial court is satisfied, after a rigorous analysis, that the prerequisites of Rule 23(a) have been satisfied." Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. v. Dukes, 564 U.S. 338, 350–351 (2011) (internal quotation marks omitted). These requirements are more than "a mere pleading standard," id., at 350, and a hasty application of Rule 23 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure can have drastic consequences, creating "potential unfairness" for absent class members and confusion (and pressure to settle) for defendants. General Telephone Co. of Southwest v. Falcon, 457 U.S. 147, 161 (1982). Recognizing these effects, Congress took the exceptional step of authorizing interlocutory review of class certification. See Fed. Rule Civ. Proc. 23(f).

Putting the kibosh on universal injunctions does nothing to disrupt Rule 23's requirements. Of course, Rule 23 may permit the certification of nationwide classes in some discrete scenarios. But district courts should not view today's decision as an invitation to certify nationwide classes without scrupulous adherence to the rigors of Rule 23. Otherwise, the universal injunction will return from the grave under the guise of "nationwide class relief," and today's decision will be of little more than minor academic interest.

Lax enforcement of the requirements for third-party standing and class certificationwould create a potentially significant loophole to today's decision. Federal courts should thus be vigilant against such potential abuses of these tools. I do not understand the Court's decision to reflect any disagreement with these concerns, so I join its decision in full.

**Justice Sotomayor, with whom Justice Kagan and Justice Jackson join, dissenting.**

[The dissent begins with a historical account of the Citizenship Clause and birthright citizenship, emphasizing that the Constitution's text grants citizenship to all persons born in the United States and subject to its jurisdiction. It explains that for over a century, this principle has been settled law, supported by Supreme Court precedent, congressional statutes, and Executive Branch practice.]

[... lengthy discussion of birthright citizenship history and Executive Order's constitutional defects omitted ...]

All three District Courts preliminarily enjoined enforcement of the Citizenship Order. Each court determined that the Citizenship Order was likely unlawful, that respondents were likely to face irreparable harm without an injunction, and that the equities and public interest cut decisively in respondents' favor. ...

The District Courts further determined that only injunctions blocking the Citizenship Order's enforcement nationwide would completely redress respondents' injuries. For the organizational plaintiffs, the Maryland District Court explained that those plaintiffs have "'over 680,000 members ... who reside in all 50 U.S. states'" and "hundreds of them expect to give birth soon." 763 F. Supp. 3d, at 746. The Washington District Court found that "a geographically limited injunction would be ineffective" for the state plaintiffs "as it would not completely relieve [the States] of the Order's financial burden(s)." 765 F. Supp. 3d, at 1153. For one thing, that court explained, the constant flow of people moving in and out of various States meant some children born to noncitizen parents in a nonplaintiff State would later reside in a plaintiff State. Once there, those children (under state law) would be eligible for state benefits. Yet due to the Citizenship Order, the plaintiff States would no longer receive federal funding to support those benefits. In addition, the plaintiff States would have to create an entirely new administrative and recordkeeping system to accommodate children who were not citizens under the Order and born in a nonplaintiff State. So if the District Court allowed birthright citizenship to continue for children born in the plaintiff States, but not in any other State, that would not completely redress the States' financial injury. Ibid.

[The Government appealed, challenging only the scope of relief, not the merits of whether the Executive Order violated the Constitution. All three appellate courts denied the Government's request and left the preliminary injunctions intact.]

[... discussion of traditional equity practice omitted ...]

The majority today adopts a crabbed view of traditional equity practice. ... [The dissent argues that the majority's historical analysis is flawed and that equity courts traditionally had broad authority to fashion appropriate relief.] ... The majority's historical analysis is incomplete and selective. It overlooks key aspects of equity jurisdiction and the development of injunctive relief in American courts.

More fundamentally, the majority's decision will have devastating real-world consequences. The Court has now created a roadmap for the Executive to violate the Constitution with impunity. Under today's holding, the Executive can implement policies that multiple courts have found likely unconstitutional, so long as those affected by the policies do not or cannot bring suit. The practical effect is to allow constitutional violations to continue unchecked against vast swaths of the American people.

Consider the specific harm here. The District Courts found that Executive Order No. 14160 likely violates the Fourteenth Amendment's guarantee of birthright citizenship—one of our Constitution's most fundamental protections. Yet under today's ruling, the Executive can continue denying citizenship to countless children born on American soil, simply because their parents have not filed suit. The majority suggests this is acceptable because those individuals could file their own lawsuits. But that is cold comfort to newborns and their families, many of whom lack the resources, knowledge, or ability to navigate our legal system. It is also no answer to say that a state or organizational plaintiff with members nationwide could bring suit, because today's decision severely limits the relief such plaintiffs can obtain.

The majority also ignores the severe administrative burden its ruling imposes. Under the Court's new regime, district courts may have to track individual plaintiffs and their specific circumstances when crafting injunctive relief. This could require courts to maintain ongoing oversight of who is covered by an injunction and who is not—a particularly difficult task when dealing with organizational plaintiffs or states representing numerous individuals. The resulting complexity will burden both courts and parties, while allowing executive lawlessness to continue in the gaps.

Perhaps most troubling, the majority's decision upends the careful balance of power between the branches. When the Executive violates the Constitution, the Judiciary has historically served as the check that ensures the law is followed. By prohibiting courts from ordering the Executive to comply with the Constitution across the board, the majority has effectively given the Executive a license to violate constitutional rights with respect to anyone who has not individually filed suit. This fundamentally alters the separation of powers and undermines the Judiciary's role in protecting constitutional rights.

The majority insists its holding is compelled by the Judiciary Act of 1789 and traditional equity practice. But that ignores a critical point: The question here is not whether courts can grant relief to nonparties, but whether courts can order the Executive to comply with the law. When a court issues an injunction prohibiting enforcement of an unconstitutional policy, it is not granting relief to the world—it is simply requiring the Executive to follow the Constitution. The fact that other individuals may benefit from the Executive's compliance does not transform the injunction into improper "relief to nonparties."

The consequences of today's decision will reverberate far beyond this case. The majority has created a powerful new tool for executive overreach. Any administration that wishes to implement a constitutionally dubious policy now knows it can do so with relative impunity, secure in the knowledge that courts cannot order complete compliance with the Constitution. Those most vulnerable—immigrants, the poor, the politically unpopular—will bear the brunt of this new regime, as they are least likely to have the resources to bring individual suits challenging executive action.

I recognize that universal injunctions have drawn criticism and that reasonable minds can differ on their appropriate use. But the answer to potential overuse of a remedy is not to eliminate it entirely, particularly when doing so leaves courts powerless to fully vindicate constitutional rights. A more measured approach would allow courts to exercise their traditional equitable discretion, crafting relief appropriate to the circumstances of each case while remaining mindful of federalism and separation of powers concerns.

The majority's decision is a stark departure from our constitutional tradition. It allows the Executive to violate the Constitution with respect to anyone who has not filed suit, effectively creating a system where constitutional rights depend not on the Constitution itself, but on one's ability and willingness to litigate. That is not how our system is supposed to work. When courts find that the Executive has acted unconstitutionally, they should have the power to order complete compliance with the Constitution. Today's decision prevents them from doing so, and our constitutional system is the worse for it.

**Justice Jackson, dissenting.**

[Justice Jackson's dissent opens with a discussion of separation of powers and the Judiciary's role in checking executive overreach. She emphasizes that in a system of government based on the rule of law, the Executive cannot be permitted to act unlawfully, even against those who have not filed suit.]

[... discussion of separation of powers principles omitted ...]

With that background, we can now turn to this suit and focus on the ways in which the majority's ruling undermines our constitutional system. Justice Sotomayor has laid out the relevant facts, see ante, at 887–891 (dissenting opinion), and I will not repeat what she has said. It suffices for my purposes to reiterate that, before these applications arrived here, three District Courts had concluded that Executive Order No. 14160—which attempts to alter the Constitution's express conferral of citizenship on all who are born in this Nation, Amdt. 14, § 1—likely violates the Constitution. Those courts each thus enjoined the Executive from enforcing that order anywhere, against anyone.

The majority now does what none of the lower courts that have considered Executive Order No. 14160 would do: It allows the Executive's constitutionally dubious mandate to go into effect with respect to anyone who is not already a plaintiff in one of the existing legal actions. Notably, the Court has not determined that any of the lower courts were wrong about their conclusion that the executive order likely violates the Constitution—the Executive has not asked us to rule on the lawfulness of Executive Order No. 14160. But the majority allows the Executive to implement this order (which lower courts have so far uniformly declared likely unconstitutional) nonetheless.

Given the critical role of the Judiciary in maintaining the rule of law, ... it is odd, to say the least, that the Court would grant the Executive's wish to be freed from the constraints of law by prohibiting district courts from ordering complete compliance with the Constitution. But the majority goes there. It holds that, even assuming that Executive Order No. 14160 violates the Constitution, federal courts lack the power to prevent the Executive from continuing to implement that unconstitutional directive.

As I understand the concern, in this clash over the respective powers of two coordinate branches of Government, the majority sees a power grab—but not by a presumably lawless Executive choosing to act in a manner that flouts the plain text of the Constitution. Instead, to the majority, the power-hungry actors are ... (wait for it) ... the district courts. See ante, at 837 (admonishing district courts for daring to "asser[t] the power" to order the Executive to follow the law universally). In the majority's view, federal courts only have the power to "afford the plaintiff complete relief" in the cases brought before them; they can do nothing more. Ante, at 851. And the majority thinks a so-called universal injunction—that is, a court order requiring the Executive to follow the law across the board and not just with respect to the plaintiff—"grant[s] relief to nonparties." See ante, at 842–844. Therefore, the majority reasons, issuing such orders exceeds district courts' authority. See ante, at 856.

[Justice Jackson's dissent then challenges the majority's premise that universal injunctions grant relief to nonparties, arguing that when a court issues an injunction, it governs the relationship between the plaintiff and defendant, with only the plaintiff able to enforce it through contempt proceedings.]

The practical consequences of today's ruling are severe and far-reaching. The majority's decision will allow the Executive to nullify the statutory and constitutional rights of the uncounseled, the underresourced, and the unwary, by prohibiting the lower courts from ordering the Executive to follow the law across the board. Moreover, officers who have sworn an oath to uphold the law are now required to allow the Executive to blatantly violate it. Federal judges pledge to support and defend the Constitution of the United States against all enemies, foreign or domestic. 5 U.S.C. § 3331. They do not agree to permit unconstitutional behavior by the Executive (or anyone else). But the majority forgets (or ignores) this duty, eagerly imposing a limit on the power of courts that, in essence, prevents judges from doing what their oaths require.

I view the demise of the notion that a federal judge can order the Executive to adhere to the Constitution—full stop—as a sad day for America. The majority's unpersuasive effort to justify this result makes it sadder still. It is the responsibility of each and every jurist to hold the line. But the Court now requires judges to look the other way after finding that the Executive is violating the law, shamefully permitting unlawful conduct to continue unabated. Today's ruling thus surreptitiously stymies the Judiciary's core duty to protect and defend constitutional rights. It does this indirectly, by preventing lower courts from telling the Executive that it has to stop engaging in conduct that violates the Constitution. Instead, now, a court's power to prevent constitutional violations comes with an asterisk—a court can make the Executive cease its unconstitutional conduct *but only with respect to the particular plaintiffs named in the lawsuit before them, leaving the Executive free to violate the constitutional rights of anyone and everyone else.

Make no mistake: Today's ruling allows the Executive to deny people rights that the Founders plainly wrote into our Constitution, so long as those individuals have not found a lawyer or asked a court in a particular manner to have their rights protected. This perverse burden shifting cannot coexist with the rule of law. In essence, the Court has now shoved lower court judges out of the way in cases where executive action is challenged, and has gifted the Executive with the prerogative of sometimes disregarding the law. As a result, the Judiciary—the one institution that is solely responsible for ensuring our Republic endures as a Nation of laws—has put both our legal system, and our system of government, in grave jeopardy.

"The accretion of dangerous power does not come in a day." Youngstown, 343 U.S., at 594 (opinion of Frankfurter, J.). But "[i]t does come," "from the generative force of unchecked disregard of the restrictions that fence in even the most disinterested assertion of authority." Ibid. By needlessly granting the Government's emergency application to prohibit universal injunctions, the Court has cleared a path for the Executive to choose law-free action at this perilous moment for our Constitution—right when the Judiciary should be hunkering down to do all it can to preserve the law's constraints. I have no doubt that, if judges must allow the Executive to act unlawfully in some circumstances, as the Court concludes today, executive lawlessness will flourish, and from there, it is not difficult to predict how this all ends. Eventually, executive power will become completely uncontainable, and our beloved constitutional Republic will be no more.

Perhaps the degradation of our rule-of-law regime would happen anyway. But this Court's complicity in the creation of a culture of disdain for lower courts, their rulings, and the law (as they interpret it) will surely hasten the downfall of our governing institutions, enabling our collective demise. At the very least, I lament that the majority is so caught up in minutiae of the Government's self-serving, finger-pointing arguments that it misses the plot. The majority forgets (or ignores) that "[w]ith all its defects, delays and inconveniences, men have discovered no technique for long preserving free government except that the Executive be under the law, and that the law be made by parliamentary deliberations." Id., at 655 (opinion of R. Jackson, J.). Tragically, the majority also shuns this prescient warning: Even if "[s]uch institutions may be destined to pass away," "it is the duty of the Court to be last, not first, to give them up." Ibid.

- Detailed procedural history of the three separate district court proceedings
- Extensive discussion of English Chancery practice and founding-era equity jurisprudence
- Respondents' arguments comparing universal injunctions to other equitable remedies
- Justice Kavanaugh's concurrence (focused on the Court's role in emergency applications)
- Much of Justice Sotomayor's dissent on birthright citizenship and historical equity practice
- Detailed footnotes and string citations throughout

**Key points preserved:**
1. **The holding:** Federal courts lack authority under the Judiciary Act of 1789 to issue universal injunctions because such remedies were not traditionally available in English or early American equity practice
2. **Critical limitation:** The Court did NOT decide whether Executive Order No. 14160 violates the Constitution—it decided only the scope of remedial authority
3. **Article III reservation:** The Court expressly declined to address whether Article III independently forecloses universal relief (footnote 4 of majority opinion)
4. **Congressional authority:** Justice Thomas's concurrence notes that "serious constitutional questions would arise even if Congress purported to one day allow universal injunctions," suggesting Congress may lack power to authorize such remedies
5. **Evasion warnings:** Justice Alito (joined by Justice Thomas) warns that the decision could be undermined through liberal grants of third-party standing to States or improper class certification
6. **Real-world consequences:** The dissents emphasize that the ruling allows the Executive to violate the Constitution with respect to anyone who has not filed suit, effectively requiring individuals to litigate to vindicate their constitutional rights
7. **Complete relief principle:** Justice Thomas emphasizes that complete relief operates as a ceiling, not a mandate—courts cannot always provide complete relief even when plaintiffs request it

**Cautions:**
- The case involves politically charged subject matter (birthright citizenship and immigration) that may distract from the remedial law issues
- Students should understand that the Court's silence on the merits of the Executive Order is significant—the case is about judicial power, not citizenship law
- The distinction between what counts as "relief to nonparties" versus ordering the Executive to comply with law is subtle but important (see Justice Jackson's dissent)
- The practical implementation of the Court's rule remains uncertain—how courts will handle organizational plaintiffs, state plaintiffs, and class actions going forward is unclear
