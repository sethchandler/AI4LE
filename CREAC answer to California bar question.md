### Claim

Dave may be charged with conspiracy to commit robbery, attempted robbery, and possibly felony murder for Fred’s death.

---

### Rule

A conspiracy occurs when two or more people agree to commit a crime and take an overt act toward its completion. Each conspirator is liable for crimes committed in furtherance of the conspiracy that are reasonably foreseeable. Attempt requires intent to commit the crime and a substantial step toward its completion. Under the felony-murder rule, a killing that occurs during the commission or attempted commission of a dangerous felony—such as robbery—is murder, even if accidental or committed by someone other than the felon, as long as the death is connected to the felony.

---

### Explanation

The rationale behind conspiracy is that agreement to commit a crime increases the likelihood that it will occur. Therefore, the law punishes the agreement and joint acts even if the crime is not completed. Likewise, attempt punishes conduct that goes beyond mere preparation. Felony murder extends liability to participants in inherently dangerous felonies because the risk of death is high and participants should bear the consequences. However, felony-murder liability may not extend if the killing was not in furtherance of the felony or was committed by someone opposing it (such as a police officer or victim).

### Application

**Conspiracy to Commit Robbery:** Dave and Fred agreed to rob a bank. Dave proposed the idea, and Fred agreed to go along. This constitutes an agreement. Their approach to the bank with guns drawn was an overt act. Thus, Dave is guilty of conspiracy to commit robbery. It does not matter that Fred had a different motive; as long as he agreed to rob the bank, the conspiracy is formed.

**Attempted Robbery:** Dave intended to rob the bank and took substantial steps—arming himself, approaching the bank, and drawing his gun. The explosion interrupted the robbery before any money was taken, but those acts likely meet the “substantial step” requirement. Dave is therefore guilty of attempted robbery.

**Destruction of Property/Terrorism-Related Offense:** Fred alone intended to detonate the grenade, but Dave did not share that purpose or even know about it. Since it was outside the scope of the robbery plan, Dave likely is not guilty of the bombing or terrorism-related offense.

**Felony Murder:** Fred was killed by Gus, a bank guard, while the robbery was in progress. Because the death occurred during the commission of an inherently dangerous felony, the prosecution could charge Dave with felony murder. However, a defense might argue that Fred’s death was caused by a third party acting in resistance, which some jurisdictions treat as outside the scope of felony murder. Still, under the proximate cause theory, Dave could be held liable because the death was a foreseeable result of the attempted robbery.

---

### Conclusion

Dave can be charged with (1) conspiracy to commit robbery, (2) attempted robbery, and (3) felony murder for Fred’s death. The felony-murder charge is debatable, but most courts would uphold it because the death occurred during an attempted robbery—a dangerous felony that Dave willingly joined.
